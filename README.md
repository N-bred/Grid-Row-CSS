# Grid Row CSS

Grid Row is a small css library designed to make the layout making process a lot easier providing different classes.

Most of the time, developers choose CSS frameworks because they make responsive web design a lot easier, these frameworks have a lot of components, classes, or even javascript, you're probably not going to use these things in 90% of the time. Its just too much.

Grid Row offers you a Grid based on the css grid system, multiple (and often enough) flexbox functionality for easier alignment of elements, and it also provides a lot of helper classes. And the best part, for only 11kb!, compare that to the 150+ kb from bootstrap.

It was created keeping in mind the things that makes other frameworks amazing.

Grid Row was designed to be only an overall layout library, it doesn't have any components, typography or anything that affects your design. Meaning that it is not as fast for prototyping projects as other frameworks, but it is perfect if you already have a design and you want to have FULL control over how things look on your page without annoying classes overwriting your custom CSS.
